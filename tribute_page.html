      <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
      <p><i>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg, in the German Empire. From a young age, Einstein displayed a natural curiosity about the world and an extraordinary ability to grasp complex mathematical concepts. Although he struggled with the rigid structure of formal education, his independent thinking and love for problem-solving led him to enroll at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, where he graduated in 1900 with a degree in physics.</i></p>
      <h3>Career Beginnings and 'Miracle Year'</h3>
      <p><i>After graduating, Einstein worked as a clerk at the Swiss Patent Office, a job that gave him ample time to think about scientific problems. In 1905, often called his 'Annus Mirabilis' or miracle year, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers that changed the landscape of modern physics. These papers introduced the special theory of relativity, the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, and the famous equation 
        E = mc<sup>2</sup>
        E = mc<sup>2</sup> , which showed the relationship between energy and mass. These achievements solidified his position as a leading physicist of his time.</i></p>
        <h3>Theory of Relativity</h3>
        <p><i>Einstein's development of the special and general theories of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. General relativity, published in 1915, described gravity as the warping of space-time by massive objects. This theory was later confirmed by astronomical observations, such as the bending of starlight during a solar eclipse in 1919. These discoveries not only redefined physics but also opened new doors for exploring the universe.</i></p>
        <h3>Nobel Prize and Scientific Contributions</h3>
        <p><i>In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, not for his theory of relativity but for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, a phenomenon crucial to the development of quantum theory. His work laid the foundation for numerous technological advancements, including solar cells and modern electronics. Beyond relativity, Einstein made significant contributions to statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and the theory of radiation.</i></p>
        <h3>Humanitarian Efforts</h3>
        <p><i>Einstein was not only a brilliant scientist but also a committed humanitarian. He spoke out against nationalism, militarism, and racial injustice, becoming an advocate for civil rights and global peace. He emigrated to the United States in 1933, escaping the rise of Nazi Germany, and became a vocal supporter of the Allied effort during World War II. However, he later expressed regret over his indirect role in the development of nuclear weapons, advocating for disarmament and international cooperation.</i></p>
        <h3>Life in Princeton and Final Years</h3>
        <p><i>Einstein spent the later part of his life at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. There, he continued to work on his elusive unified field theory, seeking to combine the fundamental forces of nature into a single framework. Despite his fame, Einstein remained modest and accessible, often emphasizing the importance of curiosity, imagination, and perseverance in scientific pursuits. He passed away on April 18, 1955, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire scientists and thinkers worldwide.</i></p>
        <h3>Legacy and Influence</h3>
        <p><i>Albert Einstein's contributions to science extend far beyond his equations and theories. His work not only transformed physics but also had a profound impact on philosophy, technology, and popular culture. Today, his name is synonymous with genius, and his life's work serves as a testament to the power of intellectual exploration and the boundless potential of the human spirit.</i></p>
