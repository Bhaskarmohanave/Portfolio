                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The Chandrayaan missions are a series of lunar exploration projects initiated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). These missions aim to explore the Moon, study its surface, and discover potential resources such as water ice. Through these missions, ISRO has made remarkable contributions to space exploration and has demonstrated India's growing capabilities in space technology.</p>

                    <li><b>Objectives:</b> To orbit the Moon, map its surface, and study the mineral composition</li>
                    <li><b>Key Achievements:</b> 
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Water Discovery: <i>Chandrayaan-1 confirmed the presence of water molecules on the Moon's surface, a groundbreaking discovery that changed our understanding of the Moon.</i></p></li>
                            <li><p>Orbiter: <i>The spacecraft successfully orbited the Moon and conducted detailed mapping of the surface and its mineral composition.</i></p></li>
                            <li><p>Scientific Contributions: <i>The data collected provided insights into the Moon's topography, mineralogy, and the composition of its exosphere.</i></p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Status:</b> The spacecraft lost communication with ISRO in August 2009, several months before its planned mission end, but the data collected before that was valuable.</li>
